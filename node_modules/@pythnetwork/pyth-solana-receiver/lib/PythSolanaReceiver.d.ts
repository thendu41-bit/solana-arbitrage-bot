/**
 * A builder class to build transactions that:
 * - Post price updates (fully or partially verified) or update price feed accounts
 * - Consume price updates in a consumer program
 * - (Optionally) Close price update and encoded vaa accounts to recover the rent (`closeUpdateAccounts` in `PythTransactionBuilderConfig`)
 *
 * This class provides methods for working with both price update accounts and price feed accounts.
 * Price update accounts are ephemeral accounts containing a single price update, whereas price feed accounts are long-lived
 * accounts that always hold price data for a specific feed id. Price feed accounts can be updated to advance the current price.
 * Applications should choose which type of account to work with based on their needs. In general, applications that
 * want the price at a specific time (e.g., to settle a trade) should use price update accounts, while applications that want
 * any recent price should use price feed accounts.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 *
 * // Get the price feed ids from https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#pyth-evm-stable
 *  const priceUpdateData = await priceServiceConnection.getLatestVaas([
 *    SOL_PRICE_FEED_ID,
 *    ETH_PRICE_FEED_ID,
 *  ]);
 *
 * const transactionBuilder = pythSolanaReceiver.newTransactionBuilder({});
 * await transactionBuilder.addPostPriceUpdates(priceUpdateData);
 * console.log("The SOL/USD price update will get posted to:", transactionBuilder.getPriceUpdateAccount(SOL_PRICE_FEED_ID).toBase58())
 * await transactionBuilder.addPriceConsumerInstructions(...)
 *
 * await pythSolanaReceiver.provider.sendAll(await transactionBuilder.buildVersionedTransactions({computeUnitPriceMicroLamports:100000}))
